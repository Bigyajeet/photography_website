## Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Project Structure

Ensure your project has the following structure:

```
your-project/
├── index.html
├── style.css
└── photo.jpg (or your chosen background image)
```

* `index.html`: Contains the main HTML structure of the sidebar and page.
* `style.css`: Contains all the CSS rules for styling the sidebar.
* `photo.jpg`: This is the background image used in the `.main_box` div. Make sure you have an image named `photo.jpg` in the same directory as your `index.html` and `style.css` files, or update the `background` property in `style.css` to point to your image's path.

### 2. Open in Browser

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Customization

* **Colors:** Modify the color values in `style.css` to match your brand or design preferences.
* **Fonts:** Change the `font-family` in `style.css` to use different fonts from Google Fonts or other sources.
* **Icons:** Explore the Font Awesome library for different icons to replace the existing ones.
* **Background Image:** Update the `background` property in the `.main_box` class in `style.css` to use your own background image.
* **Menu Items:** Add or remove list items (`<li>`) within the `<div class="menu">` section in `index.html` to customize your navigation links.
